# COLLABORATE

If you want to help at Don't fly Money - or, lets be more intimate,
DfM -, you are welcome!

Lets just make somethings clearer, to not make it a huge mess...

## GitCop

There is a bot hearing your PRs. Its name is GitCop, and it will look
all the commits and tell if it follows some rules. Yeah, I know, the
history has almost 1400 commits that definitely do not do that, but
lets just what our steps from now on, ok?

### Commit message format

The message need to have one subject and may have a body. The subject
should summarize what is done, must have no more than 50 characters,
start with the scope - part of the system that is been changed -,
followed by `:`, then by a verb and then by the description of what is
done.

The allowed verbs:
- add
- remove
- refactor
- move
- update
- fix
- replace

The body of the message is the part where the details go, if they are
necessary. To make readability easier, it must have no more than 72
characters at each line and should separate from subject and between
paragraphs by one blank line.

And, please, explain what you have done the simplest way you can.
Coding is our form of art, but the beautiful on it is other people 
understanding what you did. This rule applies to your code too.

## Don't know what to do?

It's probably not the case, but... There is a [task list](TASKS.md).
You can pickup a task from any place of the list, the order set to this
file is the order @darakeon intend to do them. Once it's ready, the new
system version number will depend on the documentation inside the task
list and the current version number.
