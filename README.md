This is a project that was been build in private Hg repository on
bitbucket. It was born at 2010 and versioned at 2011. Inspired by just wonderful people, in the middle
of 2017 I decided to change this situation.

On September 5th, 2017, 2:07am (UTC-03:00), it became OPEN SOURCE.

It's not just one more project. It's **one more** project. Even the
tallest wall is made brick by brick.

## What is the project about

This project was made to replace a sheet, that was not good enough
anymore. The system is made to control the money one spent. And has a
long list of features to implement, just like any project one do by
itself. Well, we are always our most demanding client.
