# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Don't fly money is a system composed by a website, an API and an android
app. It has only one version online at time.

Current version, next version and the entire list of improvements made
can be found at [RELEASES](docs/RELEASES.md).


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a vulnerability, got to [ISSUES](issues) in this
repository. You need to have an account at github to register an issue.

It can take a while to have an answer cause I'm the only maintainer.
I'm always trying to keep the system up to date and safe so I will
answer as soon as possible.

I always have a branch open of the next version. When I found something
that need to be fixed, one of two paths will be taken:

- The issue is urgent: I will stop the development of the new version
  and open a new branch to fix the problem;
- The issue can wait for the new version: I will add the issue to the
  list of tasks of the new version and it will be fixed as soon as the
  new version get online.
